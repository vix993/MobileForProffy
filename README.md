# MobileForProffy

This project was made during an intensive bootcamp called [NextLevelWeek #2](https://nextlevelweek.com/inscricao/2) by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). We used react-native to create the mobile application for a project called [Proffy](https://proffys.vercel.app/).

You must have expo installed on your smartphone to view the app. Otherwise, you can use the local emulator on expo, however I recommend checking the docs for memory specs.

`git clone ...`, `npm install`, `npm start`
